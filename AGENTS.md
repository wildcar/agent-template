# Agent Instructions

Primary entrypoint for any agent (Claude, Codex, DeepSeek, etc.) working in this repository.

## Project

<name> — <one-line purpose>

## Environment

- OS / shell: see `AGENTS/ENV.md`
- Commit identity: `wildcar <wildcar@mail.ru>`
- Details, credentials, command cheat-sheet: `AGENTS/ENV.md`

## Document Map

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `AGENTS.md` | This entrypoint. Workflow, rules, map. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Compatibility pointer to `AGENTS.md`. |
| `AGENTS/SPEC.md` | Functional specification — source of truth for product behavior. |
| `AGENTS/STATE.md` | Current snapshot: goal, now, next, open questions, deferred. Overwritten each iteration. |
| `AGENTS/HISTORY.md` | Append-only iteration log, newest first. Read only the top few entries. |
| `AGENTS/ENV.md` | Host, tools, credentials, command cheat-sheet. Read on demand. |

## Startup Checklist

1. Read `AGENTS.md` (this file).
2. Read `AGENTS/SPEC.md`.
3. Read `AGENTS/STATE.md`.
4. Read top 3–5 entries in `AGENTS/HISTORY.md`.
5. Check `git status --short` before editing; do not overwrite unrelated user changes.

Open `AGENTS/ENV.md` only when you need environment details.

## Change Workflow

For every iteration that changes code or behavior:

1. If the functional contract changes — update `AGENTS/SPEC.md` first.
2. Make the changes.
3. Overwrite `AGENTS/STATE.md` to reflect the new current state.
4. Prepend a new entry to `AGENTS/HISTORY.md` using the format below.
5. Commit and push after successful verification.

### `AGENTS/HISTORY.md` entry format (≤5 lines, newest first)

```
## YYYY-MM-DD · <short iteration title>
- What: <one line — what changed>
- Why: <one line — reason / task>
- Files: <key paths, comma-separated>
- Next: <one line — what was planned right after>
```

Keep each entry tight. Long explanations belong in commit messages or `SPEC.md`.

When you ship a deferred item from `STATE.md`, write a normal HISTORY entry and remove the item from `STATE.md`.

## Language Rules

- Source code, technical docs, code comments: English.
- Conversation with the user: Russian.
- End-user UI text: Russian, with ability to extend to other languages.
